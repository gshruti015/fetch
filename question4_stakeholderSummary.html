Since data engineering can get pretty technical, I have framed the discussion in a way that aligns with business goals that are more relatable to a business leader &mdash;ensuring accurate insights, reliable performance, and scalability as Fetch grows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We are primarily looking at </span><span class="c3">four key entities</span><span class="c2">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">Receipts, Brands, Items, and Users</span><span class="c1">&mdash;since they form the foundation of our data ecosystem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c3 c5">What questions do you have about the data?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before taking action, we need to confirm a few assumptions to ensure we align with business expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c3 c5">Receipts (Transaction Data)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; Should I track the </span><span class="c3">full history</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of a receipt&rsquo;s status, or is the latest status enough? This impacts how receipt validation trends are analyzed - in the sample data currently, it seems we are tracking the last status of a receipt</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&bull; Sometimes, receipts are missing item details&mdash;should those be considered valid, or are they incomplete transactions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&bull; When bonus points aren&rsquo;t awarded, there&rsquo;s often no reason recorded. Should we infer a default reason, or is that a problem we need to solve upstream?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c3 c5">Brands (Product Attribution)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; Are brand codes supposed to be </span><span class="c3">unique</span><span class="c1">, or can two brands technically share the same code?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&bull; I noticed test brands (e.g., names starting with &quot;@test&quot;)&mdash;are those to be intentionally included in reporting, I assume not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&bull; How should the missing brand assignments be handled? If an item has no associated brand, should it be excluded from analysis or attempted to assign one?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c3 c5">Items (Products in Transactions)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; Should </span><span class="c3">barcodes be globally unique</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;across all brands, or do they sometimes get reused by different brands? This changes how we match items to brands correctly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; What is the </span><span class="c3">source of truth for pricing</span><span class="c1">? I see different price fields (finalPrice, discountedPrice, itemPrice), and they don&rsquo;t always match.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&bull; What should be done when an item appears in a receipt but is not found in our product database? Should it be flagged, or is that expected behavior?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c3 c5">Users (Spenders and Account Management)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; Can a single person have </span><span class="c3">multiple account IDs</span><span class="c1">, or is that a data issue? There are cases where this happens, possibly due to data entry errors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; What should happen to </span><span class="c3">receipts from inactive users</span><span class="c1">? Do they still count toward rewards and reporting, or should they be filtered out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; If accounts get merged, should I </span><span class="c3">reassign past transactions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to the new account, or leave them as they were?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&bull; Should </span><span class="c3">fetch-staff</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">consumer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;both be considered valid for reporting?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c3 c5">How did you discover the data quality issues?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I discovered the data quality issues during a detailed audit of the data, where I closely examined different datasets and their relationships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here&rsquo;s what stood out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c5">Receipts (Transaction Data) - </span><span class="c1">performed data checks to compare the receipt data with the product database. By cross-referencing barcodes and looking for missing information (like brand assignments or reasons for zero bonus points), I identified inconsistencies</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; A huge mismatch between barcodes on receipts and our product database&mdash;only 82 out of 6,941 barcodes matched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Brand assignments were missing for over 6,300 receipts, meaning I couldn&rsquo;t correctly attribute purchases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Nearly 50% of receipts with zero bonus points had no recorded reason&mdash;this makes it difficult to explain why points are not awarded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c5">Brands (Product Attribution) - </span><span class="c1">reviewed the brand codes and categories in the dataset, which involved checking for duplicates and test data. By looking for discrepancies in how brands were categorized and assigned, I spotted issues like brands with multiple codes or missing category assignments</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Some brands were incorrectly categorized under the wrong parent brands, affecting the accuracy of reporting at the parent brand level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; A few brands had outdated data, with historical information not being properly updated, leading to discrepancies in trend analysis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c5">Items (Products in Transactions) - </span><span class="c1">performed a validation against the item master database and found items listed in receipts that didn&rsquo;t exist in the master list. Additionally, I cross-checked prices and quantities to uncover mismatches, including duplicated barcodes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Certain items had mismatched unit prices, raising concerns about the accuracy of cost and revenue reporting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Some items were linked to incorrect product categories, which made it difficult to analyze sales trends by the correct product types.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c5">Users (Spenders and Account Management) - </span><span class="c1">analyzed user accounts and transaction histories. By reviewing account IDs and transaction logs, I found issues such as multiple accounts linked to a single spender and inactive users still showing up in reward calculations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Several users had no recorded transaction history, though their accounts were active, which could be indicative of missing or incorrectly processed data.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&bull; Some users had outdated contact details in the system, affecting customer communication and potential marketing outreach</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c3 c5">What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To fix these issues, we need more clarity on business rules and expected behavior.
